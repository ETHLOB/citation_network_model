# citation_network_model
ELSEVIER Scopus data and code used to accomplish citation network research.

You will find a Python code developed to elaborate the random seed network 
and all the necessary data for this purpose. As ELSEVIER Scopus is a subscription service, 
this version of the code has been adapted to don't overstep the terms of use. This means that 
the general public can only access the metrics available in the general version of the API, 
excluding any data that requires an additional subscription service.
